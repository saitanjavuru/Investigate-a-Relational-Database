# Investigate a Relational Database

Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python - SQL Project

### Project Details
In this project, I queried the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, I queried the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. I also built visualizations to showcase the output of my SQL queries.
